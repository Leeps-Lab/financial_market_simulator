COPY INSTALL SCRIPT
cp /hb/scratch/epandolf/install.sh .

INSTALL EVERYTHING
./install.sh
- this will take some time and should not show any errors

EDIT OUTER LOOP PARAMETERS
This is a little confusing, sorry. The outer loop edits the parameters in parameters.yaml.
These are the following parameters that you need to edit in the outer loop.
`vim outer_loop.py`
use the arrow keys to navigate
scroll down to bigloop(), line 57. Edit the lines below that for what you need.
- formats
- lamda J
- lambda I
- speed
- time in force
- inventory multiplier
NOTE: THE TOTAL NUMBER OF SIMULATIONS RUN IS THE PRODUCT OF THE LENGTH OF ALL THOSE LISTS
This means, to run an inner loop with CDA, change format to CDA, and leave everything
else as it is. You will notice the lambdaI list has 6 things in it, and the time in force
list has 5. Everything else has 1.
This means there will be 1 * 1 * 6 * 1 * 5 * 1 = 30 simulations run.
For help editing this file, see the following section about editing the parameters file.

All other parameters get set in parameters.yaml.

EDIT PARAMETERS FILE:
`vim app/parameters.yaml`

'i' to enter insert mode

use arrow keys to navigate

change whatever parameters you need to

<escape> to exit insert mode

':wq' to save and exit

if you mess anything up and get stuck, press <escape> like 5 times then press ':q!'
this will quit without saving anything and you can start over with 'vim app/par...

RUN SIMULATIONS
`cd ~` to nagivate to your home directory
`./simulations.sh`
This will queue a job. You will get an email when the job starts and ends.
With 6 agents and 30 simulations of 50 rounds each, this will take about 9 hours.

GET DATA
`cd financial_market_simulator/app/data/.storage`
`ls -lht`
this will show the folders in most recently created to least recently created order
find the 4 most recently created folders. They will be the top 4.

open a new tab (not in hb)
for each folder (named a 6-character code I refer to as CODE
scp klopezva@hb.ucsc.edu:~/financial_market_simulator/app/data/.storage/CODE/processed .
cd processed
open *.png

This will copy a folder called processed to your local machine, and then you go into it and open the png files.
Then you can drag and drop them into the google doc.

You need to do this separately for each of the 4 most recent ones.
Note that the most recent one will have 2 pngs called {CODE}AV, standing for average,
and 2 called {CODE}fn, standing for final. The final one is a single simulation run at the end,
where all agents share the best strategy found.

The order should go
4th most recent
3rd most recent
2nd most recent
most recent AV
most recent fn
